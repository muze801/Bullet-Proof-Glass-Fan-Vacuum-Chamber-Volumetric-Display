TO Do Rough Draft
 
 -Get Pixel Poi for teensy on main branch
    -How to know its working?
 
 -Get code to run LSMDS91 magnetometer/accelerometer on teensy 
    -Spin LSMDS91 around and see if the values measured make any sense?
 
 -Get both sets of code to operate together 
    -Waving a APA102+LSMDS91 wand around can we display something?
 
 -Use Jhorowitz image converter, generate array to send to apa102
    -Figure out how to store and access this array from the SD slot
    -Store generated image on SD card, Access/display the array with the press of a button
    -work out how to access a sequence of Arrays 1 after another to create the elusion of an animated POV display.
